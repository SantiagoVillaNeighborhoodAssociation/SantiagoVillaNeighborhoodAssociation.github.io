## Space Park Way Renovation

This summer, Sobrato will be grinding down Space Park Way and putting down new asphalt after renovating the infrastructure underground. The project is scheduled for completion by August 31, 2024. 

### Parking will not be permitted on the north side of the street from July 15 through August 29.

Elimination of parking will make it possible to keep two-thirds of the street open so that Santiago Villa residents can continue to enter and exit the park. The local construction team will direct traffic and handle parking lot access for the occupants of the buildings on that side. Street parking will be restored after the project is completed.

#### Conditions during construction

Space Park will be divided into two unequal lanes between Shoreline and Santiago Villa.

- The narrow south lane (closest to Pear Village) will be inaccessible due to underground infrastructure reconstruction.
  - Excavation will be about 18 inches deep along the south side, but will not extend to the Shashi hotel.
  - Although underground pipes have already been replaced and repaired, those closest to the park have to be reconfigured to descend about six inches down from the ones in the park.

- The north lane is expected to be wide enough to manage two lanes of cars, providing entry and exit for mobile home residents.
  - It might be necessary to temporarily prevent cars from using the street. Because this would interfere with emergency and RV vehicles, Sobrato will do everything they can to prevent such disruption.
  - If this does occur, access to Space Park Way will be restored as soon as possible.

## Expected Benefits for Santiago Villa

- The Inigo extension from La Avenida to Pear to Space Park will create additional access to and from the mobile home park.
- The infrastructure renovation is likely to stop the seasonal flooding to the front of the park.
- The eventual realignment of Plymouth with Space Park should add a stoplight at the corner of Shoreline and S[ace Park.
