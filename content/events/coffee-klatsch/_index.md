Coffee Klatsch is a lovely event that our Neighborhood Association does, about once a month when it's warm enough (but not too warm).

They were originally on the first Saturday starting at 9am, though recently we've adjusted a bit to the schedules and needs of our community.

To find out the dates of upcoming Klatsches, check the [Events](/events) page, keep an eye out for [emails](/join), and look for the signs around the entrances to the park during the preceding week.
